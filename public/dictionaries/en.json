My responsibilities include monitoring projects, monitoring how project managers apply different methodologies. They call me a scrum master, but I just help managers manage their projects in Bitrix correctly. I reflect all useful information in the Bitrix Knowledge Base. At my job, I achieved all this thanks to the skills I acquired at RSSchool. Now I want to become a full-fledged front-end developer and apply my skills (together with back-end developers) in software development at my current job."
